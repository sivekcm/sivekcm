Hi! I'm Chris, and I am a senior studying computer science at Virginia Commonwealth University. I am very interested in full stack mobile development. I have experience working
with technologies such as Xamarin, Android Studio, and Amazon Web Servers. I really enjoy both the client and server side of mobile development, and I am currently pursuing
certifications in AWS. I am currently looking for internships for the Fall, 2021 semester.
